SciLifeLab's Data Delivery System
================================================

The *Data Delivery System* is currently in development and will be a cloud-based system for all SciLifeLab facilities where data generated throughout each project can be delivered to the research groups in a fast, secure and simple way. It consists of two components:

* The **web interface** where research groups and facilities can follow the data delivery progress. The web interface will also be an option for the delivery within small projects, e.g. projects producing small and/or few files.
* The **command line interface, cli**. This will be used for data delivery within larger projects and/or projects producing large amounts of data, e.g. sequence data.
