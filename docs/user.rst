`dds user`
==============

This section begins with a description and step-by-step guide to how you could test this command. You can find the different commands and their options at the :ref:`bottom<dds-user>` of the section. 

How to test the `dds user` command functionality
----------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   When running the commands, remember to make a note of whether or not any information or error messages are understandable and if thereâ€™s anything we need to improve on, including the documentation in this section.

From a *Unit Admin* or *Unit Personnel* account, you should be able to run all commands successfully. From a *Researcher* account, however, you will only be able to run the **dds user info** command, unless you're a *Project Owner* for a specific project. In this case you should only be able to manage accounts of other Project Owners and Researchers that are involved in the project you are set as Project Owner in. 

.. note:: 
   
   Although Project Owners and Researchers should not be able to successfully run most of these commands, we ask you to try these out anyway, and report back if anything unexpected happens.

Steps
~~~~~~~

.. note::

   These test steps assume you have already started a session with the :ref:`dds auth<dds-auth>` command.

1. Help: ``--help``
""""""""""""""""""""
Run

.. code-block::

   dds user --help

.. note::
   Please let us know whether there is any additional information that you would like to see added to the help text.

2. Get user info: ``info``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
   
.. note:: 
   
   The information printed out should contain your

   * Username
   * Role
   * Name
   * Emails connected to the account

3. Add users: ``add``
""""""""""""""""""""""

3.1. Invite a new user to the DDS

   .. warning::
      Please either use one of your own accounts or a colleague that is also involved in the testing of the DDS.

3.2. Invite the same user to DDS again
   
   .. note:: 
      This should not work and a message notifying you that the user has an ongoing invite should be displayed.

3.3. Try to invite yourself by specifying the email your current account is registered with
   
   .. note:: 
      This should not work and a message notifying you of this should be displayed.

3.4. Try to invite a user (without the `project` option) and specify the `role`

   * Unit Admin

      .. note:: 
         Should only work for other Unit Admin accounts.

   * Unit Personnel
      
      .. note:: 
         Should only work for other Unit Personnel and Unit Admin accounts.

   * Project Owner

      .. note::
         Should work for Researcher accounts assigned as Project Owners  within a specific project, Unit Personnel and Unit Admin accounts.
   
   * Researcher 

      .. note::
         Anyone should be able to invite a user with the role Researcher. 

3.5. Try to invite a user (`project` option *specified*) and the `--role`:

   * Unit Admin

      .. note:: 
         This should work for other Unit Admins as above, but there should be a message displayed saying that all Unit Admins get access to all projects within a specific unit.

   * Unit Personnel
      
      .. note:: 
         This should work for other Unit Personnel and Unit Admin accounts, but as for the Unit Admin, all Unit Personnel accounts get access to all unit projects and there should therefore be a print out of a message informing you of this.

   * Project Owner

      .. note::
         Should work for Researcher accounts assigned as Project Owners  within a specific project, Unit Personnel and Unit Admin accounts.
   
   * Researcher 

      .. note::
         Anyone should be able to invite a user with the role Researcher. 

4. Deactivate user: ``deactivate``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

4.1. Try to deactivate your own account
   
   .. note::
      This should not work and a message notifying you of this should be displayed.

4.2. Try to deactivate a fake account

   .. note:: 
      A fake account does not exist and should therefore not be possible to deactivate.

4.3. Try to deactivate another account, either one of your own, created in the steps above, or another colleagues.

   .. _deactive-other:

   .. warning:: 
      Please make sure to notify the user you are attempting to deactivate. 

   .. note:: 
      You can also attempt inviting yourself to multiple accounts and specifying different roles, after which (and after registration in the `web<web>`) you can attempt to deactivate the different accounts. Have a look at the table at the top of the section if you are uncertain about which actions should be possible.

5. Activate/Reactivate user: ``activate`` 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

5.1. Try to activate your own account

   .. note::
      This should not work and a message notifying you of this should be displayed.

5.2. Activate an account that is already activate

   .. note::
      Use one of the accounts which you invited in the steps above. They should be automatically activated once they have registered an account in the web, and therefore should not be possible to activate again.

5.3. Try to activate a fake account

   .. note:: 
      A fake account does not exist and should therefore not be possible to activate.

5.4. Reactivate the other account that you attempted (and hopefully in some cases succeeded) to deactivate in the :ref:`step above<deactive-other>`

   .. note:: 
      Try this command by specifying users with different roles. Have a look at the table at the top of the section if you are uncertain about which actions should be possible.

6. Delete user: ``delete``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. warning::
   **Do not delete any accounts during this testing period. If you wish to try out this functionality, please wait until you are finished with testing the other commands. Deleted accounts are non-reversible.**
